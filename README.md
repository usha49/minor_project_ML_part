# NPK deficiency Predictor
For our minor project, I developed a separate feature for the hydroponics app in which you could upload the image of the leaf and the model would predict 
whether the leaf has NPK(Nitrogen,Phophorous, Potassium) deficiency or it is healthy. After training the model and ensuring that it has good efficiency, 
an API was used to connect the saved model with the flutter application.
